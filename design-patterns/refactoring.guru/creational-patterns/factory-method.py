'''
Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

The Factory Method pattern suggests that you replace direct object construction calls (using the new operator) with calls to a special factory method. Don’t worry: the objects are still created via the new operator, but it’s being called from within the factory method. Objects returned by a factory method are often referred to as “products.”

why use?
when you don't know dependecies beforehand
when you want to extend a framework with your own implementation
to save system resources by reusing existing objects 

How?
1. make all product follow the same interface.
2. creator class contain the factory method and returns common product interface.
3. replace all product constructores with class method and ectract product constructor out.
4. create a set of creator subclasses for each type of products. override the factory method in the subclasses.

Pros:
You avoid tight coupling between the creator and the concrete products.
Single Responsibility Principle. You can move the product creation code into one place in the program, making the code easier to support.
Open/Closed Principle. You can introduce new types of products into the program without breaking existing client code.

Cons:
code becomes more complicated with many new subclasses.
